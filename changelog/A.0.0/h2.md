This version is _not complete_!
There is much yet to add.
This version has a simplistic UI that matches the in-game UI and has a few mods that I have been using to test my applicators. I may have issues with these applicators, so be aware that some may not work. I have ensured that everything _will_ return to normal, vanilla mechanics once you hit Apply after disabling all mods.
There is very little optimization.

_However_ - it works, and I would greatly appreciate feedback during this Alpha phase.

In order to run:
 - Download and unzip Construct.Mod.Loader.zip to an easily accessible location
 - Download and unzip Construct.zip to C:\Program Files (x86)\
 - Double click the shortcut inside the Construct Mod Loader folder

Note: If your Scrap Mechanic folder is not located at "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Scrap Mechanic\", then you will need to set it by right-clicking the .bat file, clicking edit, and changing it so that it looks like so:
`java "-DScrapFolder=Z:\Example\Location\" -jar "C:\Program Files (x86)\Construct\API\Construct Mod Loader.jar"`
Make sure that it ends in a slash, or else a large number of files will throw fits.
