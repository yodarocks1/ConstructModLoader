# Construct Mod Loader (CML) Version Alpha A.1.0 is here!
## Changes in this release:
* Source control
  * Merge and Replace files
  * Very, very basic incompatibility detection (More coming in the next update)
* New GUI
  * Includes Profiles (selection between multiple profiles coming soon)
  * Allows for dynamic selection of the mods folder, vanilla folder, and Scrap Mechanic folder within the program
    * Make sure to press `Enter` after you edit one of them!
  * Update checker (automatic updating coming soon)

## Installation instructions:
* Unzip the .zip file into `C:\Program Files (x86)`
  * This should result in a structure that looks like: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Construct\API\Construct Mod Loader.jar`
* Use the .lnk file (a Windows Shortcut) to launch the mod loader.
  * Running the program will require Administrator privileges because Scrap Mechanic and CML are located within System files.

## Known issues:
* Resizing the screen to be smaller causes the mods list to fail.
